This mod adds a new, fancy, and fully customizable enemy health bar. It doesn't replace the default bar, but offers an alternative with improved visuals.
The mod is fully compatible with multiplayer and doesn't conflict with other mods. Each player can set their own preference - if you prefer the classic vanilla health bar, you can always switch back to it.
